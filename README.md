# Social Media Sentiment Analyzer

This is a simple **Social Media Sentiment Analyzer** application built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. The app analyzes social media posts (or any user input) and determines whether the sentiment is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** based on predefined lists of positive and negative words.

## Features

- **Input**: The user can enter social media posts or any text into the input box.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The application uses basic word matching to determine sentiment.
- **Sentiment Display**: The app displays the sentiment result in color-coded text (Green for Positive, Red for Negative, and Gray for Neutral).
- **No External Libraries**: This project uses only the **Tkinter** library for the user interface and simple word-based sentiment analysis.
